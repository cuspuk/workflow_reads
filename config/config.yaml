### HYPERPARAMETERS #############################

subsampling:
  seed: 1
  n_reads: 1
  reduce_memory: true

trimming:
  shorten_to_length: 500 # OPT shorten to this length.
  max_n_bases: 3 # OPT Discard reads with more than the specified number of bases. The fifth step.
  max_expected_errors: 3 # OPT - discard reads with more expected errors than this.
  min_length_r1: 35 # OPT, minimum R1 read length. The fourth step.
  min_length_r2: 35 # OPT, minimum R2 read length. The fourth step.
  quality_cutoff_from_5_end_r1: 20 # OPT cutoff on 5' end of R1 read. The second step.
  quality_cutoff_from_3_end_r1: 20 # OPT cutoff on 3' end of R1 read. The second step.
  quality_cutoff_from_5_end_r2: 20 # OPT cutoff on 5' end of R2 read. The second step.
  quality_cutoff_from_3_end_r2: 20 # OPT cutoff on 3' end of R2 read. The second step.
  adapter_removal:
    do: true
    action: "trim" # Defines an action to perform with the found adapter.
    read_location: "anywhere" # Uses adapters defined in adapters_fasta. Searches for adapters anywhere. Possible values: 'regular', 'front',
    adapters_fasta: "path_to_adapters/adapters.fa" # Adapters fasta used for adapter trimming.

decontamination:
  kraken_dir: "path_to_kraken/KRAKEN_TAG" # Directory containing kraken DB files. If does not exist, will be downloaded using the dirname.
  # get KRAKEN_TAG from https://benlangmead.github.io/aws-indexes/k2
  exclude_taxa_ids: # list of taxonomy IDs to exclude.
    - 9606 # Homo Sapiens
  exclude_children: false # Whether to exclude reads classified at more specific levels than specified taxonomy ID levels.
  exclude_ancestors: false # Whether to exclude reads classified at all taxonomy levels between root and the specified taxonomy ID levels.
  save_memory: true # If true, kraken limits RAM memory usage but sacrifices speed.
